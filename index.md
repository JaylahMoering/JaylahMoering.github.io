## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 5, part 1

    This was one of my favorite labs and it’s when the class started making more sense. In this lab we computed the area of a rectangle, this task is simple, so creating a program to do this helped me gain a deeper understanding on how to use functions to complete a task and streamline code. For example, instead of using “std::cout” then “std::cin” multiple times to prompt the user to input the length and width, we created a function called “PromptForInt” that would achieve the same result. 

* Lab 6, part 1

    This was another great lab, it helped me get familiar with programs involving vectors. We declared a vector called “command_line” and each index of the vector was declared to be a component of a sandwich. To run the program we would type ./sandwich and inter three arguments, our protein, a bread, and a condiment. After, our program would generate a sentence ordering the sandwich. I also learned how to limit the number of arguments entered by the user by using a boolean statement. If the size of the vector was not equal to 4, then we generated an error statement informing the user that there could only be three arguments. 

* Lab 7, part 1

    This was another one of my favorite labs. We created a program for parking rules, something that could be used in real life to administer parking citations. We created functions for each street in our assignment consisting of different boolean statements, afterwards we used these functions to determine whether or not parking on a street was “allowed” or “not allowed”. This helped me gain a deep understanding on boolean statements and when to use certain operators.
